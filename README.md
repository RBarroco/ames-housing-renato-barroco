Objectives

The main objective of this work is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, dive into features engineering, use Regression Machine Learning tools and reach as minimum as possible value of mean_absolute_error in forecasts.<br/>

Tools:

1) Ridge Regression, Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting. <br/>
2) A dicussion about standarization of data, in linear regression vs. more complex models.<br/>
3) Polynomial Features in different degree, and why to use them.<br/>
4) Split data between training set and testing set.<br/>
5) Cross validation method, using different regressions methods inclusive: GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV.<br/>
6) Exploratory data analysis to find outliers, to understand strong vs. weak correlation between predictor variables themselves and between predictor variables vs. target variable.<br/>
7) Feature Engineering (One hot Encode) based on categorical unordered, handling categorical ordered data through mapping technique, and handling 'NaN' data.<br/>
8) Correlation matrix, heatmap of correlation matrix, overall multi- and uni-variate analysis.<br/>
